given:
the loan amount
the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
the loan duration

need: 
monthly interest rate: interest /12
loan duration in months: convert total years + months to months

formula: let m = p * (j / (1 - Math.pow((1 + j), (-n))));

m = monthly payment
p = loan amount --given 
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

monthly interest: Take loan amount, divide by 12 and multiply by interest rate.

START 

GET loan amount, apr, loan duration and SET to const variables
find monthly interest rate by taking apr and dividing by 12
take loan duration and count total number of months (i.e: 1 year and 2 months = 14 months)

plug all values into formula and solve for monthly payment

print monthly payment as $123.45 or $371.00
